To interact with the BingX API using Python, you can choose between two packages: `python-bingx` and `bingX-connector`. Both packages offer different interfaces and functionalities to interact with various aspects of the BingX platform, including trading, managing accounts, and retrieving market data.

### Using `python-bingx`

- **Installation**: Install the package via pip.
  ```bash
  pip install python-bingx
  ```
- **Initialization**: Import the `BingX` class and initialize it with your API key and secret key.
  ```python
  from bingX import BingX
  bingx_client = BingX(api_key="your_api_key", secret_key="your_secret_key")
  ```
- **API Calls**: You can call various APIs such as the Perpetual V2 Trade API.
  ```python
  bingx_client.perpetual_v2.trade.trade_order()
  ```
- **Handling Responses**: Responses are returned in JSON format, which you can parse as needed.
  ```python
  response = bingx_client.perpetual_v2.market.get_ticker("BTC-USDT")
  symbol = response["symbol"]
  last_price = response["lastPrice"]
  ```
- **Error Handling**: The package raises exceptions for errors, which you can catch and handle.
  ```python
  from bingX import ClientError, ServerError
  try:
      response = bingx_client.perpetual_v2.trade.create_order()
  except (ClientError, ServerError) as e:
      error_code = e.error_code
      error_message = e.error_message
  ```

### Using `bingX-connector`

- **Installation**: Install the package via pip.
  ```bash
  pip install bingX-connector
  ```
- **Initialization**: Choose the specific module based on the API you want to interact with (e.g., Standard, Spot, Perpetual).
  ```python
  from bingX.standard import Standard
  client = Standard(api_key="your_api_key", api_secret="your_api_secret")
  ```
- **API Calls**: Similar to `python-bingx`, you can call various APIs according to the chosen module.
  ```python
  # Example for creating an order in the Perpetual API
  from bingX.perpetual.v2 import Perpetual
  client = Perpetual(api_key="your_api_key", api_secret="your_api_secret")
  client.trade.trade_order()
  ```
- **Documentation**: For detailed documentation and API references, refer to the official BingX API documentation [here](https://bingx-api.github.io/docs/).

Both packages are designed to simplify interactions with the BingX API, but they cater to slightly different needs. `python-bingx` provides a more general interface, while `bingX-connector` offers a structured approach tailored to specific API modules. Choose the one that best fits your project requirements.
