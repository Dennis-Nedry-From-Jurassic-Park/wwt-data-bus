To create a portfolio of Ethereum addresses in Python, you can follow these steps, combining insights from the provided sources:

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

First, ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. Then, install the `web3` library, which allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, including generating Ethereum addresses.

```bash
pip install web3
```

### Step 2: Generate Ethereum Addresses

Create a Python script named `generate_addresses.py`. This script will generate Ethereum addresses and store them in a list. Each address will also be associated with a unique private key, which should be securely stored.

```python
from eth_account import Account
import secrets

# Function to generate a new Ethereum address
def generate_ethereum_address():
    # Generate a random private key
    priv = secrets.token_hex(32)
    private_key = "0x" + priv
    
    # Create an account object from the private key
    acct = Account.from_key(private_key)
    
    return acct.address, private_key

# List to hold generated addresses and their private keys
addresses = []

# Generate 10 Ethereum addresses
for _ in range(10):
    address, private_key = generate_ethereum_address()
    addresses.append((address, private_key))

# Print the generated addresses and their private keys
for addr, pk in addresses:
    print(f"Address: {addr}, Private Key: {pk}")
```

This script generates 10 Ethereum addresses along with their private keys. Adjust the loop count according to your needs.

### Step 3: Securely Store Private Keys

It's crucial to keep private keys secure. Consider encrypting them or storing them in a secure vault or database. Never expose private keys publicly.

### Step 4: Interact with Ethereum Blockchain

Once you have your Ethereum addresses, you can use the `web3` library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. For example, you can check balances, send transactions, or interact with smart contracts.

Here's a simple example to get the balance of one of the generated addresses:

```python
from web3 import Web3

# Connect to an Ethereum node
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'))

# Get the balance of the first generated address
balance = w3.eth.get_balance(addresses[1][1])
print(f"Balance: {w3.fromWei(balance, 'ether')} ETH")
```

Replace `'YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual Infura project ID. You'll need to sign up for an Infura account to get access to Ethereum nodes.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can generate a portfolio of Ethereum addresses and interact with the Ethereum blockchain using Python. Remember to handle private keys securely and consider using additional libraries or APIs for more complex interactions with the blockchain.
