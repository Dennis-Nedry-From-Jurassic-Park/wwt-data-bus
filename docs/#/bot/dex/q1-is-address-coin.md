To check if an Ethereum address is an ERC-20 token address using Python, you would typically need to interact with the Ethereum blockchain to verify the contract at that address against the known ERC-20 interface. However, based on the provided sources, there isn't a direct method or Python script shared for this specific task. Instead, the sources discuss creating, deploying, and interacting with ERC-20 tokens using tools like Brownie and Web3.py.

Here's a general approach to achieve what you're asking for, assuming you have the `web3.py` library installed:

1. **Install web3.py**: If you haven't already, install the `web3.py` library, which allows Python applications to communicate with the Ethereum blockchain.

   ```bash
   pip install web3
   ```

2. **Connect to an Ethereum Node**: Use a service like Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode to connect to the Ethereum network. You'll need an API key from one of these services.

3. **Check the Contract Interface**: To determine if an address is an ERC-20 token, you can attempt to fetch its ABI (Application Binary Interface) and then inspect it for the presence of ERC-20 functions such as `transfer`, `balanceOf`, etc.

Here's a basic example script that demonstrates how to connect to an Ethereum node and attempt to fetch the ABI for a given address. Note that this script does not guarantee success because the address might not be an ERC-20 token, or the contract might not expose its ABI publicly.

```python
from web3 import Web3

# Connect to an Ethereum node via Infura
infura_url = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(infura_url))

# Address to check
address_to_check = '0xYourAddressHere'

# Fetch the contract ABI
try:
    contract_abi = w3.eth.contract(address=address_to_check).abi
    print(f"The address {address_to_check} has an ERC-20-like ABI.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Could not fetch ABI for {address_to_check}: {str(e)}")

# Inspect the ABI for ERC-20 functions
erc20_functions = ['transfer', 'balanceOf']
for func_name in erc20_functions:
    try:
        # Attempt to call a function to see if it exists
        result = getattr(contract_abi, func_name)
        print(f"{func_name} found in the ABI.")
    except AttributeError:
        print(f"{func_name} not found in the ABI.")
```

Replace `'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'` with your actual Infura project ID or another provider's URL, and replace `'0xYourAddressHere'` with the Ethereum address you wish to check.

This script attempts to fetch the ABI for the given address and checks for the presence of common ERC-20 functions. Keep in mind that this is a simplistic approach and might not cover all scenarios or ERC-20 variations.

To check if an Ethereum address is an ERC-20 token holder, you would typically interact with the ERC-20 token's smart contract to query the `balanceOf` function. However, since you're asking about checking an address against a specific ERC-20 token, I'll guide you through a general approach using Python and Web3.py, assuming you have the address of the ERC-20 token you're interested in.

First, ensure you have Web3.py installed:

```bash
pip install web3
```

Then, you can write a Python script to check if an address holds any tokens of a specific ERC-20 token. Here's a basic example:

```python
from web3 import Web3

# Initialize a Web3 instance
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"))

# The address of the ERC-20 token you want to check
token_address = "0xYourTokenContractAddress"

# The address you want to check
address_to_check = "0xYourAddressToCheck"

# The ABI of the ERC-20 token (you might need to adjust this based on the specific token)
erc20_abi = [
    {
        "constant": True,
        "inputs": [{"name": "_owner", "type": "address"}],
        "name": "balanceOf",
        "outputs": [{"name": "", "type": "uint256"}],
        "payable": False,
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
    }
]

# Create a contract instance
token_contract = w3.eth.contract(address=token_address, abi=erc20_abi)

# Call the balanceOf function
balance = token_contract.functions.balanceOf(address_to_check).call()

# Print the result
print(f"The balance of the address {address_to_check} is {balance} tokens.")
```

Replace `"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"` with your Infura project ID or any other Ethereum node provider you're using. Also, replace `"0xYourTokenContractAddress"` with the actual contract address of the ERC-20 token you're interested in, and `"0xYourAddressToCheck"` with the Ethereum address you want to check.

This script initializes a Web3 instance, connects to the Ethereum network, creates a contract instance for the ERC-20 token using its contract address and ABI, and then calls the `balanceOf` function to check the balance of the specified address. If the balance is greater than zero, it means the address holds tokens of the ERC-20 token.

Remember, this is a basic example. Depending on the specifics of the ERC-20 token and what exactly you're trying to achieve, you might need to adjust the ABI or handle additional logic.
