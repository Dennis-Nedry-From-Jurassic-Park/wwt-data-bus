Cairo is a language for writing provable programs: 
running a Cairo program produces a trace 
that can then be sent to a trustless prover, which generates a STARK proof

The SHARP is the connecting link between 
your Cairo code 
and 
your Solidity smart contract. 
It has three main components 
â€“ a prover (off-chain), 
- a verifier smart contract (on-chain) and 
- a FACT REGISTRY CONTRACT (on-chain)
