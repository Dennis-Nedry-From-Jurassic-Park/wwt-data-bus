To convert a cryptocurrency to WETH (Wrapped Ether) using `eth_call`, you would typically interact with a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. However, since the direct conversion involves complex interactions with smart contracts and might require specific conditions to be met (like having enough ETH/WETH balance), the process cannot be simplified to a single `eth_call`. Instead, you would perform a series of steps involving interacting with the Uniswap router contract to swap your token for WETH.

Here's a general outline of how you could approach this, assuming you're familiar with Solidity and have access to a local Ethereum node or a service like Infura:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**: Ensure you have Node.js installed and set up a project directory. You'll also need the web3.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

2. **Set Up Web3 Provider**: Connect to an Ethereum node. This can be a local node or a remote one through services like Infura.

3. **Interact with Uniswap Router Contract**: The Uniswap Router contract (`0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D`) is responsible for facilitating swaps between tokens. You'll need to construct a transaction that calls the `swapExactTokensForTokens` function, specifying the amount of your token you wish to swap, the minimum amount of WETH you expect to receive, the path (which includes both your token and WETH), the recipient (usually yourself), and the deadline for the transaction.

4. **Sign and Send Transaction**: Once you've constructed the transaction, sign it with your private key and send it to the network.

Here's a simplified example using web3.js:

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3('YOUR_INFURA_URL');

// Replace these variables with your own values
const uniswapRouterAddress = '0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D';
const yourTokenAddress = 'YOUR_TOKEN_ADDRESS'; // Address of the token you want to swap
const wethAddress = '0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2'; // WETH address on mainnet
const yourAccount = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS';
const privateKey = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY';

const amountIn = web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether'); // Amount of your token you want to swap
const amountOutMin = web3.utils.toWei('0.95', 'ether'); // Minimum amount of WETH you expect to receive
const path = [yourTokenAddress, wethAddress];
const to = yourAccount;
const deadline = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 20; // 20 minutes from the current time

const data = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
  name: 'swapExactTokensForTokens',
  type: 'function',
  inputs: [{
    type: 'uint256',
    name: '_amountIn'
  }, {
    type: 'uint256',
    name: '_amountOutMin'
  }, {
    type: 'address[]',
    name: '_path'
  }, {
    type: 'address',
    name: '_to'
  }, {
    type: 'uint256',
    name: '_deadline'
  }],
}, [amountIn, amountOutMin, path, to, deadline]);

const tx = {
  from: yourAccount,
  to: uniswapRouterAddress,
  data: data,
  gas: 200000,
};

web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(tx, privateKey).then(signedTx => {
  web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedTx.rawTransaction);
});
```
