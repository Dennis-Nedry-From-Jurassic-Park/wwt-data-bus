1. **CoinGecko**: CoinGecko is a cryptocurrency data platform that provides comprehensive information about cryptocurrencies, including historical price data. It offers an API that allows developers to fetch historical price data for Ethereum and many other cryptocurrencies. You can find the API documentation and start using it to retrieve historical price data with timestamps.

2. **CryptoCompare**: CryptoCompare is another popular platform that offers extensive cryptocurrency data, including historical price charts and statistics. They have an API that provides access to historical price data for Ethereum and thousands of other cryptocurrencies. The API allows you to specify the timeframe and granularity of the data you're interested in.

3. **CoinMarketCap**: CoinMarketCap is widely recognized for its comprehensive cryptocurrency market data.

By querying the API, you can obtain historical price data for Ethereum, including timestamps.

It offers a range of data retrieval capabilities, including historical price data.

5. **Etherchain**: Etherchain is a dedicated Ethereum block explorer that provides detailed information about transactions, blocks, and addresses on the Ethereum network. While it may not directly offer historical price data, it can be used in conjunction with other data sources to track the value of Ethereum over time.

Each of these platforms has its own set of features, limitations, and pricing models, so it's worth exploring them further based on your specific requirements. Remember to review the documentation for each API to understand how to structure your requests and what kind of data you can expect to receive.
